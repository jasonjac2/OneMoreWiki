Although OneNote has multiple slick ways of navigating around notebooks, sections, and pages,
the most obvious feature missing is a Favorites menu. Well, you now have one with OneMore.

### Add current page
Adds the current page to the end of the favorites menu.

### Manage Favorites
Opens the Settings dialog and shows the Favorites Manager sheet

### Save Custom Snippet
Saves the selected content as a new named snippet. Once saved, the snippet can be inserted onto any page, at any location, by clicking the snippet on the Favorites menu.

Snippets can be used to easily insert repeatable content such as custom styled tables, blocks of text, signature lines, etc.

### My Saved Plugins
If you've created and saved custom plugins, they will be listed as a separate sub-menu off of the Favorites menu.
Click the _Manage Saved Plugins_ item to open the Plugin Manager where you can edit, rename, or delete plugins.
Or click a plugin from the menu to immediately invoke it.

### Manage Custom Snippets
Opens the Settings dialog and shows the Snippets Manager sheet

### OneNote Keyboard Shortcuts
This is a special link that can be enabled in the [Favorites Manager](Settings).

The first time this link is clicked, OneMore will download an import and keyboard shortcuts reference page under the current section and show that page. It may take a couple of seconds to appear.

Subsequent clicks will simply show that page again. 

This page can be moved to any open notebook or section and OneMore will still find it. If the page is deleted, clicking the Favorite link will download it again.
