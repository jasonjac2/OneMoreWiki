Although OneNote has multiple slick ways of navigating around notebooks, sections, and pages,
the most obvious feature missing is a Favorites menu. Well, you now have one with OneMore.

### Add current page
Adds the current page to the end of the favorites menu.

### Manage Favorites
Opens the Settings dialog and shows the Favorites Manager sheet

### OneNote Keyboard Shortcuts
This is a special link that can be enabled in the Favorites Manager.

The first time this link is clicked, OneMore will download an import and keyboard shortcuts reference page under the current section and show that page. It may take a couple of seconds to appear.

Subsequent clicks will simply show that page again. 

This page can be moved to any open notebook or section and OneMore will still find it. If the page is deleted, clicking the Favorite link will download it again.
