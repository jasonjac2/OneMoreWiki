### Table of Contents

The Table of Contents command can run in one of three modes:

* Insert a table of contents at the top of the page with hyperlinks to all the standard and custom
  headings on the page. Optionally, add a "top of page" link to each heading on the page to quickly
  jump back to the top of the page.
* Create a new page at the top of the section with hyperlinks to all pages in the current section
* Create a new page at the top of the section with hyperlinks to all sections in the current
  notebook and optionally include all pages in each section. 

Generate a Table of Contents based on both standard headings and custom user-defined headings
where each line is hyperlinked to its heading and indented according to its heading level.
Text colors are based on the page background color.

to which you can add content.

### Status Labels

Insert colored status labels similar to the Status macros found in Confluence. These
are not as smart as the Confluence macros but instead are just simple text with a highlight
background that are fully editable inline.

### Information and Warning Boxes

Insert an information box or warning box with fully customizable headers and content.
These snippets are actually just nested tables. Text colors are based on the [page background
color](#dark).

### Calendar

Insert a monthly calendar for a selected month in either large or small format. The small
format is good for a quick look at a month. The large format is good for entering brief
daily notes.
