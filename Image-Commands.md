The Add Caption command will add a caption to the selected image by moving the image
into a one-row, one-column table and centering the word "Caption" below the image, which of
course you should edit immediately. If your custom styles has a style named exactly "Caption"
then that style will be applied, otherwise, a default caption style is used.

The Crop command opens an image editing window that allows you to precisely crop and image
by selecting a region, moving that region around the image, and even resizing the region.

The Resize command can be used to resize images on the page. If one image is selected then
you can resize by percentage, absolute size, or to a preset width with aspect ratio maintained.
If more than one image is selected, or no images are selected, then you can resize them all to
a preset width. The preset width is saved so you don't need to keep entering it if you have a
width you typically use.
