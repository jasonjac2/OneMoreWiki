## Copy Section Group
Accessed by right-clicking a section group, copies a section group (folder) to another notebook or section group. Note that sections on each level of the hierarchy must have unique names. If there are two sibiling sections with the same name then pages may be copied only to the first section.

## Date stamp pages in section
Prepends the title of each page with the created date of the page using the form YYYY-MM-DD.
If a page title already contains that value, no changes are made. This command is available
from the Extra menu or by right-clicking a section.

## Insert Pronunciation
Inserts the "ruby text" pronunciation of selected words. This uses an online service that supports over a dozen languages.

## Insert Timer Value (F2)
Inserts the current value shown in the timer window. The timer window must be started using the Start Timer command.

## Sort
Sorts pages, sections, or notebooks. Pages are sorted within the current section only,
not recursively throughout the notebook. Sections are sorted throughout the current
notebook recursively.

## Start Timer (Alt + F2)
Starts and opens a visual timer. This small window will first appear in the upper right corner of the display and immediately starts counting seconds, minutes, and hours. There are three controls on the window: copy the current value to the clipboard, restart the timer from zero, and close the timer. The window can be moved but is limited to the current desktop window.

The current value shown in the timer window can easily be inserted into the body of the open page by using the Insert Timer command.

## Strikethrough Completed To Do Tags
Toggles strikethrough text next to all completed/incompleted tags

## Word Count
Displays the number of words on the current page or in the selected region. The word count may differ - be slightly lower - than the word count reported by Microsoft Word because Word counts things like URLs as a single word but OneMore separates the individual words in the URL. For example, Word reports one word in "https://github.com/OneMore" whereas OneMore counts it as four words.
