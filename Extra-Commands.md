## Insert Pronunciation
Inserts the "ruby text" pronunciation of selected words. This uses an online service that supports over a dozen languages.

## Merge pages
Merges two or more pages into a single page preserving formatting and position of outlines.

## Replace URLs with Web Page Titles
Automatically replaces all or selected hyperlinked URLs with the &lt;title> specified on the 
associated Web pages. This only affects URLs for which the displayed text is the same as the
link address, meaning if you've already customized the displayed text, OneMore will not alter
your changes.

For example, given this URL on a OneNote page: [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)

it would be replaced with its hyperlinked title: [GitHub](https://github.com)
