The Custom Styles gallery and Editor provide an easy way to create new styles from scratch
or from the currently selected text, modify those styles and save them for later use. You
can then either apply a single style to selected text by choosing a style from the gallery
or use the *Apply Custom Styles to Page* command to apply all custom styles to the entire
page, looking for headers, citations, quotes, code, and normal text.

The first nine custom styles are automatically bound to the key sequences
Ctrl+Alt+Shift + 1, Ctrl+Alt+Shift + 2, etc., through Ctrl+Alt+Shift + 9
