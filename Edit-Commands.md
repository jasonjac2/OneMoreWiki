## Colorize
Applies colorized syntax highlighting to selected source code. Supported languages include: 

- C#
- CSS
- HTML
- Java
- JavaScript/JSON
- PowerShell
- Python
- Typescript
- VB
- XML

The highlighting is not as complete as you might find in VS or VSCode but then OneNote isn't intended to be a programming editor anyway. However, languages are defined in JSON definition files located below the OneMore installation directory so they can be customized and enhanced and new languages can be added.

If you're so inclined to add enhancements or define a new language, please submit a pull request.

## No Spell Check

## Paste Rich Text
Pastes rich text from the clipboard, preserving formatting and colors.

## Rotating Highlighter
Uses a rotating array of colors to highlight selected text. Each time you select text and use this command, it will highlight the selected text using the next color in the array. Choose the color theme from the Settings dialog.
