## Colorize
Applies colorized syntax highlighting to selected source code. Supported languages include: 

- C#
- CSS
- HTML
- Java
- JavaScript/JSON
- PowerShell
- Python
- Typescript
- VB
- XML
- YAML

For best results, first select the text you want to colorize, set the style to Code, and then colorize the selection.

The highlighting is not as complete as you might find in VS or VSCode but then OneNote isn't intended to be a programming editor anyway. However, languages are defined in JSON definition files located below the OneMore installation directory so they can be customized and enhanced and new languages can be added.

If you're so inclined to add enhancements or define a new language, please submit a pull request.
